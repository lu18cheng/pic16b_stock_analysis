## Abstract
Growth stock investing and value stock investing have been the most common strategies in equity investing, and the debate over their effectiveness has lasted for years. In this project, we will study the past stock data to compare the performance of growth stock vs. value stocks over different periods and use machine learning models to examine their correlations with various macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation rate, GDP growth rate, etc. In summary, we hope our project can provide more insights for the retail investors into which strategy is more effective for a given time horizon and under various economic conditions.

## Planned Deliverables
An overall interactive website/blog that includes the following content:
- an informative webpage detailing methodologies, findings and our conclusion. They can be multiple brilliant and complex graphs to demonstrate our results and the weighted stock prices
- an interactive interface so that users can do various scenario analysis to adjust their portfolio accordingly. For instance, there could be a toggle so the website user can choose the specific time horizon: '5 years' '10 years''20 years', or the economic conditions shift: "interest rate increases 0.25%", "GDP growth rate slows down by 0.5%", etc. In short, it will be an interactive model so that users can do various scenario analysis to adjust their portfolio. 

## Resources Required
- Stock prices for the past 50 years from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- Macroeconomic indicators for the past 50 years from [Federal Reserve's website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- If the data is large, may also require cloud environment to store data & train machine learning model 

## Tools and Skills Required
- Time series Machine learning models (maybe start with ARIMA in statsmodels package)
- Background knowledge on stocks
