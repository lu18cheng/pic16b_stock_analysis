# pic16b_stock_analysis

## Abstract
This project compares the performance of growth stock vs. value stocks over different time periods and their correlations with various macroeconomic factors (interest rates, GDP growth, etc.). We would utilize machine learning models to analyze stock performance. 

## Planned Deliverables
- A jupyter notebook including step-by-step analysis for the stocks 
- An interactive website/blog that provides insights to investors about values stocks vs growth stocks to investors

## Resources Required
- Stock data (need a link to data) 
- Criteria to divide value stock vs growth stocks 
- If the data is large, may also require cloud environment to store data & train machine learning model 

## Tools and Skills Required
- Time series Machine learning models (maybe start with ARIMA in statsmodels package)
- Background knowledge on stocks 

## What You Will Learn
- Version control with git 
- Time series machine learning models 
- Project management 

## Risks

## Tentative Timeline
- In 2 weeks: obtain data and train a preliminary model
- In 4 weeks: organize insights from model and start writing report 
- In 6 weeks: finalize the report and clean up code
