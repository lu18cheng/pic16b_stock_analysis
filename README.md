## Abstract
Growth stock investing and value stock investing have been the most common strategies in equity investing, and the debate over their effectiveness has lasted for years. In this project, we will study the past stock data to compare the performance of growth stock vs. value stocks over different periods and use machine learning models to examine their correlations with various macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation rate, GDP growth rate, etc. In summary, we hope our project can provide more insights for the retail investors into which strategy is more effective for a given time horizon and under various economic conditions.

## Planned Deliverables
- A jupyter notebook including step-by-step analysis for the stocks 
- An interactive website/blog that provides insights to investors about values stocks vs growth stocks to investors

## Resources Required
- Stock data (need a link to data) 
- Criteria to divide value stock vs growth stocks 
- If the data is large, may also require cloud environment to store data & train machine learning model 

## Tools and Skills Required
- Time series Machine learning models (maybe start with ARIMA in statsmodels package)
- Background knowledge on stocks 

## What You Will Learn
- Version control with git 
- Time series machine learning models 
- Project management

## Tentative Timeline
- In 2 weeks: obtain data and train a preliminary model
- In 4 weeks: organize insights from model and start writing report 
- In 6 weeks: finalize the report and clean up code
