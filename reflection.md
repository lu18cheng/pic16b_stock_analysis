## Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 
- In this project, we got to practice writing Python code and learned many useful skills relate to data science proejcts. We did some fun analysis and learned more about the stock market. 

## What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 

## What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project?
- Obtain and use data for a longer term (e.g. 50 years instead of 20)to train the model to increase prediction accuracy.

## How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? 
- We pretty much followed the timeline and goals set in our intial proposal. However, we won't able to obtain an accurate enough model to help us predict the market and provide meaningful insights about how the market responds to changes in macroeconomic indicators. 

## What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc? 
- We learned many useful skills through this project, from project management, communication and presentation skills, to version control (github), data base management, data visualization,  machine learning modeling and webdesign

## How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible. 
- This experience is helpful to help us prepare for a data science career as it mimics the process of a complete data science project in a real life experience. In actual working setting, we imagine most projects would go through the process of proposal -> data collection & cleaning -> actual analysis -> presentation of results. Version control with git is also a crucial tool in working setting. Moreover, many of the difficulties we encounter in this project could be similar to what we may encounter in real life. Being able to detect where the issues come from and exploring ways to solve it is a useful skill to have when working on industry projects.
